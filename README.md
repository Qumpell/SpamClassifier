# Spam classifier
> This project implements a spam classifier using a Naive Bayes classifier and tf-idf (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weighting. The classifier can distinguish between spam and non-spam messages based on a trained model.

### Training Data

The training of the spam classifier requires a labeled dataset containing examples
of both spam and non-spam messages. In this project,
the training data can be obtained from the following source:
